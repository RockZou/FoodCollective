(and the BYOB policy didn't hurt, which is also now gone since they've moved into a larger space.)\n\nOtto's is pretty rad, however I get the potato/bacon/scallion slice every. single. time.\n\nI've only eaten at Primo once, but it was one of the greatest meals of my life.  Had heard *so* much about the place, that I figured it was bound to disappoint on some level after so much praise, and I'm happy to say that everything we ordered (and we ordered a lot) blew us away.  Truly phenomenal, and I love their food philosophies (seasonal, local, sustainable).\n\nI'd also add to this list:\n\nMiccuci's Pizza in Portland.  Unlike any other pizza I've ever eaten (the loftiest dough in all of the land).  Has to be eaten to be believed.\n\nSaeng Thai in Portland.  The only thai restaurant that I'll go to in all of Maine, as I've found all of the others to be disappointing and either pan-asian, or not thai at all.  Saeng Thai, on the other hand, is as thai as it gets (I spent 4 months in Thailand during a year in Asia) and the food there is hands down the best thai food that I've eaten outside of Thailand.\n\nPai Men Miyake in Portland.  Sister restaurant of Miyake, and it's basically a noodle house.  Admittedly, the place got some pretty bad reviews when it fist opened, but their spicy miso soup with pork belly is about the best rainy-day food in existence.  That, coupled with crispy pig tail and an order of pork buns, and I'm in heaven.\n\nAsmara in Portland.  Hours are weird/unreliable, but the food is amazing, and the owner is an incredibly sweet and talented woman.  I recommend the lamb tibsi, but everything that I've had here is phenomenal.\n\nFive Fifty-Five in Portland.  When you want to get fancy in Portland, this is my top choice.  Without a doubt, the best service in Portland, and the food is always impressive and always changing (while keeping some of the favorites as a staple on the menu).  The lamb ragu that I had there last month blew me away.  I'll often just sit at the bar and get their steak and fries with an order of fried olives, and I'll be a happy man.\n\nThe Frosty Pint in Portland.  Best flippin' buffalo wings I've ever had in my life.  Crappy sports bar with a relatively bad selection of beer (but I'm a IPA/microbrew nerd), but the wings make me keep coming back.  I think Bingas has been absolute crap ever since they had the fire a few years ago, and apparently the owner of Bingas even goes to the frosty pint when he's craving wings.  Not to be missed.\n\nTu Casa in Portland.  When my wife and I moved to Maine after living and travelling in places with abundant great mexican food, we were shocked, dismayed, and depressed at the utter lack of decent mexican food in Southern Maine.  We eventually stumbled on Tu Casa (technically Salvadorian food from El Salvador, the country directly south of Mexico) and all of our needs have been met.  I'd recommend the \"enchiladas salvadorenas with chicken\" (not really enchiladas, but more like tostadas), smothered in their homemade green salsa...and a cheese pupusa (similar to a quesadilla with a corn tortilla).  They also have specials like (fresh) fish tacos, tamales, and other glorious dishes.

Boda is my go-to Thai restaurant because of their late night menu and their small plate/apps menu. Fun to mix n&amp;#39; match, and they also have an amazing ginger mojito. And Bintliffe&amp;#39;s for breakfast/brunch. They have a whole page of their menu just dedicated to Eggs Benedict.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_n75as", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c36xntk", "created": 1323557915.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1323557915.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qts0", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "Maine", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "c374up4", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "epicanis", "parent_id": "t3_n75as", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you're in Northern Maine, there's a hole-in-the-wall lunch/dinner place in East Millinocket called \"Soup to Nuts\" that's very good (cash only, only open weekdays).", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "maine-flair", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in Northern Maine, there&amp;#39;s a hole-in-the-wall lunch/dinner place in East Millinocket called &amp;quot;Soup to Nuts&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s very good (cash only, only open weekdays).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_n75as", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c374up4", "created": 1323631925.0, "author_flair_text": "North Maine Woods", "created_utc": 1323631925.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qts0", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "Maine", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "c378ti3", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "LiquidCure", "parent_id": "t3_n75as", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Otto's Pizza in Portland. \nhttp://ottoportland.com/pdf/enzo_pressherald.pdf", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otto&amp;#39;s Pizza in Portland. \n&lt;a href=\"http://ottoportland.com/pdf/enzo_pressherald.pdf\"&gt;http://ottoportland.com/pdf/enzo_pressherald.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_n75as", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c378ti3", "created": 1323657769.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1323657769.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qts0", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "Maine", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qts0", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "Maine", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "c37cbv9", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RobotPartsCorp", "parent_id": "t1_c36txn5", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ok Linda bean.......", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "maine-flair", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok Linda bean.......&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_n75as", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c37cbv9", "created": 1323693685.0, "author_flair_text": "Portland", "created_utc": 1323693685.0, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "c36txn5", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Doctuh", "parent_id": "t3_n75as", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Thirsty Pig in Portland for beer and sausages.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thirsty Pig in Portland for beer and sausages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_n75as", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_c36txn5", "created": 1323525351.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1323525351.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qts0", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "Maine", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "c379b2w", "gilded": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ep0k", "parent_id": "t3_n75as", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "For heaping platters of delicious meat, [Gauchos Churrascaria](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=gauchos+portland+maine&amp;hl=en&amp;cid=9494229640356038584) in Portland.
